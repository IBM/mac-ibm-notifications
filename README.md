<!-- Not always needed, but a scope helps the user understand in a short sentance like below, why this repo exists -->
## Scope

The purpose of this project is to provide a template for new open source repositories.

<!-- A more detailed Usage or detailed explaination of the repository here -->
## Usage

This repository contains some example best practices for open source repositories:

* [LICENSE](LICENSE)
* [README.md](README.md)
* [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)
<!-- A Changelog allows you to track major changes and things that happen, https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator can help automate the process -->
* [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

> These are optional

<!-- The following are OPTIONAL, but strongly suggested to have in your repository. -->
* [dco.yml](.github/dco.yml) - This enables DCO bot for you, please take a look https://github.com/probot/dco for more details.
